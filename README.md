# Data-Pre-Processing (Data preprocessing can refer to manipulation or dropping of data before it is used in order to ensure or enhance performance,[1] and is an important step in the data mining process. The phrase "garbage in, garbage out" is particularly applicable to data mining and machine learning projects. Data-gathering methods are often loosely controlled, resulting in out-of-range values (e.g., Income: âˆ’100), impossible data combinations (e.g., Sex: Male, Pregnant: Yes), and missing values, etc.)
